- [X] Persuasion

## Installation
Install OpenAI Python API library 
```sh

```

Set **OPENAI_API_KEY** environment variable. Replace *your-api-key-here* with your actual OpenAI API key.
```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

## Important: Prototype Code Only
These examples are quick prototypes designed to validate core assumptions and demonstrate key features. They are not production-ready and have several limitations:

- Lack proper design patterns and architectural best practices
- Missing comprehensive error handling and validation
- No security considerations or performance optimizations
- Limited testing and documentation

Do not deploy this code to production environments. Use these examples as learning materials and starting points for properly architected solutions.
